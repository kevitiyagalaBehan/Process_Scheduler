# Multi-Core CPU Scheduling Simulation 

comparing two scheduling algorithms (FCFS and RR) across different load levels.

## Features

- Simulates **First-Come-First-Served** and **Round Robin** scheduling algorithms
- Supports three workload levels (low, medium and high)
- Calculates:
  - Average waiting time
  - Average turnaround time
- Generates plots and bar chart comparing algorithm performance trends

## How to run the program?

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the program
    ## Using Terminal/Command prompt:
       - Navigate to the directory containing source code file (cpu_scheduler.py)
       - Run the simulation (python cpu_scheduler.py)
       - Console will display simulation summaries
       - Plots and bar graph will appear automatically
    ## Using PyCharm:
       - Open the project in PyCharm
       - Run the "cpu_scheduler.py"
       - Check console for summaries and plots and bar graph will appear automatically
